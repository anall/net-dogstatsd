Net-Dogstatsd

This module provides a simple Perl client to 'dogstatsd', a daemon provided with
the Datadog agent software. Its purpose is to aggregate sending of custom
metrics to the Datadog service.  dogstatsd is very similar to statsd, but
supports additional metric types, as well as adding informational tags to
metrics (which makes for easy "slicing and dicing" of your metrics within the
Datadog graphs/dashboards.

Datadog (http://http://www.datadoghq.com/) is a service that will 
"Capture metrics and events, then graph, filter, and search to see what's 
happening and how systems interact. Datadog is a service for IT,
Operations and Development teams who write and run applications at scale, and
want to turn the massive amounts of data produced by their apps, tools and
services into actionable insight."
